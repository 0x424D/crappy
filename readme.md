This repository is a collection of practice programs that I write. Most of them will be random standard algorithms.

I'll write them all without referencing any pseudocode, which is why the code will probably be horrible and messy.

`bsearch`: binary search algorithm in C

`SRTToVTT`: quick python script to convert SRT files to VTT files

`msort`: merge sort algorithm in Python 3.x

`cg_mmult`: a code golf (107 character) implementation of matrix multiplication in Python 3.x

`pwned`: Emulates the functionality of Dr. Mike Pound's script shown in the Computerphile video "Have You Been Pwned?" (full video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhUb5iknVJs).
