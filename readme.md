This repository is a collection of practice programs that I write. Most of them will be random standard algorithms.

I'll write them all without referencing any pseudocode, which is why the code will probably be horrible and messy.

bsearch: binary search algorithm in C
SRTToVTT: quick python script to convert SRT files to VTT files
